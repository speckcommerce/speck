SpeckCommerce
=============
Version 0.0.1

Introduction
------------

SpeckCommerce is an open source e-commerce platform written on Zend Framework 2.
The most notable feature of SpeckCommerce is the incredibly flexible [modular
design](https://github.com/speckcommerce/speck/wiki/Module-Separation-Strategy).
The SpeckCommerce project was started by companies and developers who were
unsatisfied with the overall quality of the
[existing](http://www.magentocommerce.com/) [open](http://www.oscommerce.com/)
[source](http://www.zen-cart.com/) [e-commerce](http://www.ecartcommerce.com/)
[platforms](http://www.opencart.com/) written in PHP.  Legeraging our collective
e-commerce knowledge and years of experience building and working with
e-commerce platforms, we're building what we hope to be the fastest, most
flexible, and well-built e-commerce platform built in PHP.

A secondary goal of SpeckCommerce is to be an exemplary model of the powerful
new module system in Zend Framework 2.

currently in use:
